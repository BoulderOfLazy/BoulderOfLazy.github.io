<div id="slot-1" class="slot"><strong>Portal 2 (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/portal-2">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>Besides being arguably one of the best games ever made, it&rsquo;s also one of the best introductions to video games as a medium</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-2" class="slot"><strong>Disco Elysium (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/disco-elysium">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>In an earlier version this slot held Cyberpunk 2077, but after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN0jTJidig_8LLvAAhRm8VlU-Adpqk2S3">SovietWomble&rsquo;s streams</a> and the mobile release (🤮🤮🤮), I remembered Disco Elysium and put it here</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-3" class="slot"><strong>Dishonored (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/dishonored">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>I really like this watercolor art style that definitely adds to the grim atmosphere of the game. Disco Elysium was here, but I decided to place it in the slot that it deserves even more.</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-4" class="slot"><strong>The Alters (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/the-alters">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>This slot can be for puzzle games or for titles that give you something to think about. The Alters belongs to the latter category with a very interesting concept, and during my playthrough I often thought "What if?" about my life choices</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-5" class="slot"><strong>Into the Radius (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/into-the-radius">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>One of the spiritual successors to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series in VR; my playtime stretched out because my PC doesn&rsquo;t run it perfectly (I could run it on the headset, but the graphics are too poor there). Also, it&rsquo;s a pretty scary game for me :-)</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-6" class="slot"><strong>Batman Arkham (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/batman-arkham-collection">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>The most influential superhero game series and also my favorite. I take Arkham Origins into account too, even though it&rsquo;s not in the official collection</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-7" class="slot"><strong>Nine Sols (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/nine-sols">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>This game has some of the most satisfying parries in the industry, and the combat as a whole is very engaging thanks to the protagonist&rsquo;s rich moveset that rewards aggression</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-8" class="slot"><strong>DOTA 2 (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570">Steam</a>)</strong><br />
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the community will agree with me here</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-9" class="slot"><strong>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/s-dot-t-a-dot-l-k-dot-e-r-dot-anomaly">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>What S.T.A.L.K.E.R. should have been: a world stitched from locations across all three parts, enhanced A-Life, and many other additions. And with the GOG release, installation got even easier</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-10" class="slot"><strong>Baldur's Gate 3 (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">IGDB</a>)</strong>
<p>After three playthroughs, it&rsquo;s not surprising BG3 overtook my previous most played game, PAYDAY 2</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-11" class="slot"><strong>Your Only Move Is Hustle (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2212330/">Steam</a>)</strong><br />
<p>A severely underrated turn-based fighting game - a good introduction to fighting game basics. With Steam Workshop mods it becomes practically endlessly replayable</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-12" class="slot"><strong>Alpha Protocol (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/alpha-protocol">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>The dialogue system, the story and its reactivity were enough for me to fall in love with this game</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-13" class="slot"><strong>Boneworks (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/boneworks">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>The physics engine and world interactivity are exceptional for VR, but the problem is there&rsquo;s little else in the game. The weapon behavior is very satisfying though, but there are only a few enemy types and none of them are very interesting</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-14" class="slot"><strong>Batman Arkham Origins (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/batman-arkham-origins">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>IMO fans criticize it too harshly. The tone of the narrative differs from Rocksteady&rsquo;s games and the plot resembles a story from Batman's <em>film</em>, rather than comic book, which has pros and cons. The gameplay borrows from Arkham City (with simplified mechanics), which for me places it above Arkham Asylum</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-15" class="slot"><strong>Dragon Age: Origins (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-age-origins">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>I can see why the story is praised, but gameplay feels very archaic by today's standards</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-16" class="slot"><strong>Terraria (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/terraria">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>These two categories could have been used for random indie/AAA recommendations, but the second one already has enough publicity and for the first I had nothing better to put here</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-17" class="slot"><strong>Resident Evil 4 (2023) (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-4--1">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>See the explanation for the previous category</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-18" class="slot"><strong>Postal 2 (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/postal-2">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>Those three words fit no other game better. I&rsquo;m not even sure there&rsquo;s anything else more suitable for this slot</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-19" class="slot"><strong>Minecraft (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/minecraft--1">IGDB</a>)</strong>
<p>Works both as a child&rsquo;s creative canvas and a family-friendly game thanks to a low barrier to entry. Definitely better than some brainrot like Roblox</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-20" class="slot"><strong>Alan Wake II (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/alan-wake-ii">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>One of those sequels that is on a whole different level compared to the first part - in many respects it&rsquo;s superior, apart from the story which was already strong</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-21" class="slot"><strong>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>The team made an RPG you can confidently compare to BG3 in terms of narrative depth (and gameplay if you enjoy the math)</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-22" class="slot"><strong>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Trilogy (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/stalker-collection">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>One of the rare series where atmosphere is the main reason people love the games. These titles immerse you deeply in their world despite some weak gameplay aspects</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-23" class="slot"><strong>Vergil from the Devil May Cry series (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/collections/devil-may-cry">IGDB</a>)</strong>
<p>It was hard to pick someone for this category since memorable villains aren&rsquo;t that common in video games. I picked Vergil largely because I keep seeing him in memes</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-24" class="slot"><strong>Kazuma Kiryu from the Yakuza: Like a Dragon series (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/collections/yakuza-like-a-dragon">IGDB</a>)</strong>
<p>As funny as he is, he&rsquo;s also inspiring with his trustfulness, kindness, and strong sense of justice. The ideal role model if you think being a himbo is your calling</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-25" class="slot"><strong>Kim Kitsuragi from Disco Elysium (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/disco-elysium">IGDB</a>)</strong>
<p>The best companion in the history of video games. Nuff said</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-26" class="slot"><strong>Watch Dogs (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/watch-dogs">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>Putting the word "potential" next to a Ubisoft game is bold, I know. But I&rsquo;m looking at the concept of an open-world hacker game set in the near future. The idea itself has huge potential - I can already imagine it done in the style of <a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/shadows-of-doubt">Shadows of Doubt</a></p>
</div>
<div id="slot-27" class="slot"><strong>Deus Ex: Mankind Divided (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/deus-ex-mankind-divided">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>I've never felt genuinely <em>disappointed</em> by games, but Deus Ex: Mankind Divided came close. The way the story abruptly ends is jarring, especially knowing a sequel will likely never come</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-28" class="slot"><strong>Resident Evil 2 (2019) (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-2--1">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>A remake that changed the industry. Now many new releases are reboots or remasters with varying degrees of quality and change.</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-29" class="slot"><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>There was a time when Call of Duty campaigns were excellent. I put the first Black Ops here because I liked it the most from that era.</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-30" class="slot"><strong>Deep Rock Galactic (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>One of the few co-op games where systems force not only shooting AI enemies together but real cooperative interaction between players, something many such games forget (even if it starts and ends on placing a platform underneath a scout that's hanging on the wall</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-31" class="slot"><strong>Furi (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/furi">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>On normal difficulty it&rsquo;s not too hard, but Furi+ will make anyone sweating (partially due to poorly telegraphed dashes of player's character)</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-32" class="slot"><strong>Hypnospace Outlaw (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>I picked this because not everyone has nostalgia for early-2000s internet, and the visual style is unusual. I, however, also don't have this nostalgia. I played mostly for exploring different corners of a retro internet simulation</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-33" class="slot"><strong>The Sims 4 (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/the-sims-4">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>I haven&rsquo;t played many simulators, and The Sims stands out partly because my parents used to play the older ones</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-34" class="slot"><strong>Love, Money, Rock'n'Roll (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/love-money-rocknroll">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>I put this here mostly as a joke, but the fact that it emotionally drained me after multiple playthroughs with pretentiously long monologues from the protagonist is notable</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-35" class="slot"><strong>DOOM (2016) (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/doom--2">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>I was torn between DOOM and Alan Wake II, but chose DOOM because I prefer heavier music</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-36" class="slot"><strong>Earth Defense Force 5 (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/earth-defense-force-5">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>Persistent desync, unbalanced difficulty curve, repetitive gameplay, and RNG-based progression - yet I still played about 70 hours with friends and can recommend it to someone who is able to play this with others</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-37" class="slot"><strong>Beat Saber (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/beat-saber">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect slicing blocks to be that addictive. My favorite way to exercise</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-38" class="slot"><strong>Straftat (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/straftat">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>If the developer hadn&rsquo;t added a four-player mode, I might not have played it - 1v1 PvP isn&rsquo;t my thing. With three friends it&rsquo;s chaotic and fun, and for free it&rsquo;s great</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-39" class="slot"><strong>Alan Wake's American Nightmare (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/alan-wake-s-american-nightmare">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>I don&rsquo;t have many favorite developers or many hated games from them, but this one deserves the spot. The core gameplay copied from the first game remains unexciting, and the game loops through the same three locations with minimal changes - at least it&rsquo;s short</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-40" class="slot"><strong>Hi-Fi Rush (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/hi-fi-rush">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>Microsoft/Xbox "effective managers" made an incredible decision to kick Tango Gameworks out after they produced one of the highlights of 2023. Thank god they were picked up by KRAFTON and now they can make a worthy sequel...<br /><br />...<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805509/krafton-pubg-ai-first-developer-agentic-gpu-cluster">right?</a></p>
</div>
<div id="slot-41" class="slot"><strong>Doom Eternal (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/doom-eternal">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>The pinnacle of shooter design (at least until Ultrakill releases)</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-42" class="slot"><strong>Class of '09 (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/collections/class-of-09">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>I love the edgy, politically incorrect, absurd humor in this game. Whether the creator is a moron or not doesn&rsquo;t change my opinion of his work</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-43" class="slot"><strong>Duck Game (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/duck-game">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>The funniest party game with surprisingly deep gameplay</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-44" class="slot"><strong>Sclerosis: The Dark Descent (<a href="https://createam.itch.io/sclerosis">Itch.io</a>)</strong><br />
<p>A fan-made port of Amnesia: The Dark Descent for VR and Android. It&rsquo;s so scary I haven&rsquo;t dared to play it on my Quest 3 :D</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-45" class="slot"><strong>OTXO (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/otxo">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>A spiritual successor to Hotline Miami - I like the core gameplay rather than the roguelike elements, which are fairly shallow here</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-46" class="slot"><strong>Abiotic Factor (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/abiotic-factor">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>Arguably one of the best survival games with narrative focus on the market, with a memorable setting and lots of QoL touches the genre often lacks</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-47" class="slot"><strong>Call of Duty (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/call-of-duty">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>Either this or Dungeon Keeper 2. I&rsquo;ll always remember the assault on a building with trench lines and the training section for throwing grenades</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-48" class="slot"><strong>Alan Wake 3 (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/alan-wake-3">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>I just hope Remedy don&rsquo;t go bankrupt before they get to release it</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-49" class="slot"><strong>Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection (<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/">Official site</a>)</strong><br />
<p>A collection of various puzzles. Offline (or in-browser), no ads, free</p>
</div>
<div id="slot-50" class="slot"><strong>Half-Life: Alyx (<a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/half-life-alyx">IGDB</a>)</strong><br />
<p>Those who know, know ;-)</p>
